Requires:
Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools

Usage:
1. Open an Anaconda Prompt and activate the environment you want to install scipy with openBLAS.
2. Change to the directory where the build-scipy-openblas.bat is and run the batch file. Just type build-scipy-openblas in the prompt.
3. The batch will install the required packages to build and will pause before the build starts. Make sure you read the attention warning about adjusting the processor power to avoid overheating.
4. Continue with the build.
5. Check the installation by importing scipy and its submodules in a python script
